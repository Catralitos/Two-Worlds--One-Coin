# Two Worlds, One Coin

Gerard woke up this morning and decided to go grocery shopping in Lidl, but what he didn't know was that today he would have to face a huge obstacle.... 

Upon arriving to the payment queue, he noticed a couple old ladies in front of him. After about an hour, Gerard decided he couldn't take this insolence no more and with a flip of a coin travels to an alternate reality where he is fighting a giant boss.

The key to changing realities is to flip a coin. If it lands on Heads the player will stay/return to Lidl if it lands on Tails....well...good luck.
